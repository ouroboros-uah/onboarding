# History of Spaceflight

As a student of electric propulsion, it is important to understand the history of spaceflight, how EP fits into that history, and the relevance of the technology today.

## Early Theories & Pioneers (1900s-1940s)
Modern rocketry began with theorists who envisioned spaceflight long before the technology existed.

* 1903: Tsiolkovsky’s Foundation: Russian schoolteacher Konstantin Tsiolkovsky published the Rocket Equation, mathematically proving that space travel was possible via multi-stage rockets and liquid propellants.

$$
\Delta v = v_e \ln \left( \frac{m_0}{m_f} \right)
$$

* 1920s–30s: The Great Pioneers: Robert Goddard (USA) launched the first liquid-fueled rocket in 1926, while Hermann Oberth (Germany) popularized the concept of space stations and interplanetary travel.

* WWII: The V-2 Rocket: Under Wernher von Braun, Nazi Germany developed the V-2. While a weapon of war, it became the first man-made object to reach the edge of space, serving as the direct ancestor to both Soviet and American space launchers.

## The Dawn of the Space Age (1950s-1960s)
The Cold War transformed rocket science into a race for national prestige.

* 1957: Sputnik 1: The USSR shocked the world by launching the first artificial satellite, proving that space was reachable and orbit was maintainable.

* 1961: Vostok 1: Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space, completing a single orbit and returning safely, sparking the American commitment to reach the Moon.

* 1969: Apollo 11: NASA’s Saturn V rocket successfully landed Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface, marking the pinnacle of the early space race.

## Expansion & Competition (1970s-1980s)
Post-Apollo, the focus shifted from "planting flags" to long-term presence and deep-space observation.

* 1971: Salyut 1: The USSR launched the first space station, beginning the era of long-duration human spaceflight.

* 1977: Voyager Probes: NASA launched Voyager 1 and 2, which are currently the most distant man-made objects, providing our first close-up looks at the outer planets.

* 1981: The Space Shuttle: NASA debuted the first reusable spacecraft, designed to make access to orbit routine and facilitate large-scale construction in space.

## International Collaboration (1990s-2000s)
The end of the Cold War saw former rivals working together on massive engineering feats.

* 1990: Hubble Space Telescope: Despite initial mirror flaws, Hubble revolutionized astronomy by providing clear views of the deep universe, free from atmospheric distortion.

* 1998: The International Space Station (ISS): Assembly began on the ISS, a permanent laboratory in orbit representing the collaborative efforts of the US, Russia, Europe, Japan, and Canada.

## The New Space Era (2010s-Present)
We are currently in a "Space Renaissance" driven by commercialization and a return to deep-space exploration.

* The Rise of Private Space: Companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Rocket Lab have slashed the cost of launch through vertical landing and reusability.

* Commercialization: Space tourism and private orbital labs are becoming a reality, moving space access away from purely government-funded models.

* Ambitions for the Future: NASA’s Artemis program aims for sustainable Moon bases, while private and public entities focus on the logistical challenges of a human mission to Mars.
