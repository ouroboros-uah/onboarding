    This documentation is meant to be used as an internal reference. **Please do not share this document or its contents outside the project team.**
    
    The knowledge contained here is adapted from: 
    
    * *Physics of Electric Propulsion* by Jahn, 
    * *Fundamentals of Electric Propulsion: Ion and Hall Thrusters* by Goebel and Katz, and 
    * Graduate-level curriculum from **MAE 642: Introduction to Electric Propulsion** (Dr. Gabe Xu and Dr. Kirk Boehm).

Team leadership recognizes that contributing to high-level electric propulsion research requires a steep learning curve. We are committed to providing the direction and skill-building necessary for you to move from a new recruit to a primary driver of the evolution of our project. Your ability to contribute to OUROBOROS begins with a rigorous foundation in theory.
