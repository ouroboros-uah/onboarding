# Fields and Fundamental Laws

To design and build electric thrusters, we must move beyond the behavior of single particles and understand the governing "structural laws" of the universe: **fields**. This lesson covers the fundamentals and basic laws of electromagnetism, which we use to our advantage in designing electric propulsion devices.

## Electric Fields and Voltage

Electric fields ($\vec{E}$) are created by charges and exert forces on other charges in their vicinity. The force between two point charges ($q_i, q_j$) separated by a distance ($r$) is expressed by **Coulomb's law**, defined as:

$$\vec{F_{ij}}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{{r_{ij}}^{2}}\hat{r_{ij}}$$

Note that the permittivity of free space ($\epsilon_{0}$) is a constant equal to $8.854 \times 10^{-12} \text{ F/m}$.

Since force vectors can be added together, the total force on one particle is simply the sum of contributions of all other particles. Coulomb's law becomes difficult with large numbers of particles. In electric propulsion, it is not uncommon for us to deal with plasmas whose density is quintillions ($10^{18}$) of particles per cubic meter. 

When dealing with large numbers of particles, we define a Charge Density ($\rho$) in $C/m^3$. **Gauss's Law** relates the spreading of the electric field to the charge at that point:

$$\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{E}=\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{0}}$$

We can do work against this electric field, moving particles. **Voltage** ($V$), also known as **electric potential**, is defined as the strength of the electric field on a path added up from infinity to a specific point. This can be thought of as the work per unit charge needed to push the charge against the field between the desired points. 

!!! tip "Math Magic: Decoding the Symbols" 
    Vector calculus is used extensively when deriving the theory behind electromagnetism. If you aren't familiar with this area, don't worry. Here are a few intuitive ways to think about the most common vector calculus operators:

    * $\nabla \cdot$ (**Divergence**): Think of this as a fountain. Divergence measures if a field is "flowing" out from a point (like water from a sprinkler). Positive divergence means the field is flowing out, negative divergence means the field is flowing in, and zero divergence means the field doesn't spread out at all.

    * $\nabla \times$ (**Curl**): Think of this as a whirlpool. Curl measures if a field is twisting or rotating around a point. Positive curl goes counterclockwise.

    * $\int d\vec{A}$ (**Area Integral**): This measures **Flux**, like counting how much rain falls through a window frame.

    * $\oint d\vec{l}$ (**Path Integral**): This measures **Circulation**, like walking a lap around a track and adding up the wind resistance.

## Magnetic Fields and Current

Magnetic fields ($\vec{B}$) are produced by moving charges, known as currents. Current density ($\vec{j}$) represents the flux of charged particles across a given area, calculated as $\vec{j}=\sum nq\vec{v}$. 

**Ampère’s Circuit Law** relates the magnetic field integrated around a closed loop to the current passing through it:

$$\oint\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l}=\mu_{0}I_{enclosed}$$

Note that the magnetic permeability of free space $\mu_{0}$ is a constant equal to $4\pi \times 10^{-7} \text{ T·m/A}$.

If we extend this idea to an infinitely long wire, we find the **Biot-Savart Law**, used to calculate the magnetic field strength generated by a current-carrying wire.

$$dB=\frac{\mu_{0}I}{4\pi}\cdot\frac{d\vec{l}\times\vec{r}}{|\vec{r}|^{2}}$$

## Magnetic Forces and Symmetry

Now say we have two wires. If both carry current, they exert a force on one another. For two long parallel wires, we can apply **Ampère’s Force Law** to find that force:

$$\frac{F}{L}=\frac{\mu_{0}}{2\pi}\frac{I_{1}I_{2}}{r}$$

We can derive **Gauss’s Magnetic Law** from Ampère’s Force Law, which states that the divergence of any magnetic field is always zero:

$$\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{B}=0$$

This proves that magnetic field lines always form closed loops; there is no such thing as a "magnetic monopole" (a north pole without a south pole).

## Induction and the Maxwell-Faraday Law

Consider a time-varying magnetic field, with a circular loop of wire placed in the field. This time-varying magnetic flux ($\Phi_B = \int \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A}$) induces a voltage (electromotive force), which can drive a current in the wire. This phenomenon is described by the **Maxwell-Faraday Law**:

$$\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{E}=-\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$$

!!! tip "Application: Explosively Pumped Flux Compression Generator" 
    These single-use devices generate a high-power electromagnetic pulse by using high explosives to rapidly compress magnetic flux. They are used in research for fusion, pulsed power, and electromagnetic warfare.

## Maxwell's Equations in Free Space (Differential Form)

So far, we have covered four very important equations, which together are known as **Maxwell's Equations**. These govern all of classical electromagnetism in free space. 

* Gauss’s Law states that electric fields are created by charge density: $\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$

* Gauss’s Magnetic Law states that no magnetic monopoles exist: $\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0$

* The Maxwell-Faraday Law states that changing magnetic fields create electric fields: $\nabla \times \vec{E} = -\frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$

* Ampere’s Circuit Law states that currents create magnetic fields: $\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{j}$
